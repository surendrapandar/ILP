# Streaming and Buffering in Node.js

## Introduction

In Node.js, streaming and buffering are essential concepts for handling data efficiently, especially when dealing with large datasets or network operations. Understanding these concepts is crucial for building scalable and performant applications.

### Streaming

Streaming is a mechanism for reading or writing data piece by piece, rather than loading the entire dataset into memory at once. In Node.js, streams are instances of `Readable`, `Writable`, or `Duplex` classes that enable reading from or writing to a continuous flow of data.

#### Advantages of Streaming:
- **Efficiency:** Streaming allows processing large datasets without loading them entirely into memory, which reduces memory usage and improves performance.
- **Real-time Processing:** Streams enable real-time processing of data as it becomes available, making them suitable for tasks like file I/O, network communication, and data processing pipelines.
- **Pipelining:** Streams can be piped together to create data processing pipelines, where the output of one stream becomes the input of another, enabling modular and reusable code.

### Buffering

Buffering is the process of temporarily storing data in memory before it's processed or transferred. In Node.js, buffers are instances of the `Buffer` class that represent fixed-size chunks of binary data.

#### Advantages of Buffering:
- **Efficient Memory Management:** Buffering allows data to be stored in memory temporarily, which can be processed or transferred in chunks, reducing the risk of memory exhaustion.
- **Asynchronous I/O:** Buffers facilitate asynchronous I/O operations by providing a way to read or write data in chunks, improving performance and responsiveness.
- **Error Handling:** Buffers can be used to accumulate data before processing it, enabling error handling and retry mechanisms in case of failures.

## Example: Reading from a File Stream

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

// Create a readable stream from a file
const readStream = fs.createReadStream('example.txt');

// Read data from the stream in chunks
readStream.on('data', (chunk) => {
    console.log('Chunk:', chunk.toString());
});

// Handle end of stream
readStream.on('end', () => {
    console.log('End of stream');
});

```
