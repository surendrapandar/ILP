## Building a File Upload Progress Bar with React, TypeScript, and Node.js


### Technologies Used:

`React`: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

`TypeScript`: A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing.

`Node.js`: A JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications.

`Express`: A web framework for Node.js.

`Multer`: A middleware for handling multipart/form-data, which is commonly used for file uploads.

### Project Overview

__Frontend (React)__

The frontend of our application will consist of a simple form for uploading files and a progress bar to visualize the upload progress.

`Components`:

`FileUploadForm`: Renders a form for uploading files.

`ProgressBar`: Displays the progress of file uploads.

`Backend` (Node.js with Express)
The backend will provide an API endpoint for uploading files. 

We'll use Multer middleware to handle file uploads and emit progress events to track the upload progress.

`Routes`:
POST /upload: Endpoint for uploading files.

`Middleware`:
Multer: Handles file uploads and emits progress events.


__File Upload Process__

1. User selects a file using the file input in the frontend.

2. The selected file is sent to the backend using an HTTP POST request.

3. The backend receives the file, starts the upload process, and emits progress events.

4. The frontend listens for progress events and updates the progress bar accordingly.

5. Once the upload is complete, the backend sends a response to the frontend indicating the success of the upload.
